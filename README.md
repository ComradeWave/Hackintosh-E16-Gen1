Hello! Thanks for checking this repo out!

So this is my first time making a Hackintosh system, so it will be janky

WHAT WORKS:
- [x] Audio
- [x] Ethernet
- [ ] Wi-fi/Bluetooth (no drivers)
- [ ] Battery Status (ECEnabler.kext does not work, i need a help patching the SSDT)
- [x] Hardware acceleration (with Nootedred)
- [ ] HDMI (untested)
- [x] Usb ports, although untested
- [ ] Touchpad
- [x] Trackpoint

All of this has been tested on SEQUOIA
